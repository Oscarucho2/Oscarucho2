# âœˆ Summary
I'm an computer engineer and a software developer ðŸ’». I'm 23 years old, i'm really interested in web programming. One of my best qualities is my full-time programming learning, i'm always trying to read, watch and learn some stuff about all the documentation of new languages, frameworks, etc.  
I really like to play videogames ðŸŽ®, listen to music and sometimes hang out with my friends.
